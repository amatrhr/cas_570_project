# CAS Project Notes 1
# First synopsis
Schools are represented as nodes in a network comprising a 'school system.'
Each school has logistic growth in either an independent or community model 
Nodes have the following properties:
    - growth rate r (real in (0.,1.))
        this is an increasing function of the node's degree and the district's constant growth rate & competition coefficients
    - carrying capacity k (integer in (0, 5000))
        this is a constant inherited from the district at the time of creation and is an increasing
        function of the district's Harary index 
    - 'competition' or 'mutualism' coefficients (real in (-1., 1.)) that reflect ease and direction of transfer between schools.
    - population N (integer in (0,5000))
    - district D (qualitative)

Districts have the following intrinsic properties:
    - growth rate r_d (real constant in (-1.,1.)) -- this is the effect of migration to or from the 
    catchment area. 
    - competition coefficients with neighboring districts (real in (-1.,1.))
        - neighboring districts are the union of the districts of the neighbors of any schools in the district.

A school will be closed if its population falls below 0.

If all schools in the district are at their carrying capacity, a new school will be created at the lowest-degree school in the district (suburban growth model) or at the highest-degree school in the district (urban growth model).  If the district graph would become non-planar, this school will also form a new district. Alternatively, there is a constant mutation probability (& possibly a second-order function of growth rate).

Metrics of this model: Student/school ratio; cardinality of the number of neighbors between districts, Harary index & mean detour index; closure rate; diameter of each district.

# Revision 1:
    - Don't determine districts as a separate type of entity--more like blocks or strongly connected components (also have more emphasis on random shock growth rates for certain nodes)

# Implementation ideas
    - a network-node class
    - a class for iteration of a set of network nodes 
    - something that extends from the two node model (sagebrush and daisy) to multi-node (school or school-district)--maybe a district is the proper level of analysis, especially for the criticality part--relationship between forcing a field and sensitivity of the inference to replacement

    - Be ready to start 

# Need to consider dirichlet model and ??? (relation to )
